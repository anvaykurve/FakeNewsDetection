Set up Python in VSCode. Built a pipeline and Git Integration

Setup Git repository

Learned the following things in Python:

Variables & Data Types: Storing data using Strings, Integers, Floats, and Booleans.
String functions

------------------------------------------------------
Collections:

Lists: Ordered, mutable collections. 

Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections.

Dictionaries: used to store data objects with a key. 

------------------------------------------------------

Control Flow:

If/Else Statements: Elif is used within a block

Loops: for and while loops

------------------------------------------------------
Functions

The def keyword: Defines a reusable block of code.

Modules: Importing external code libraries

File I/O: How to open, read, write, and append text files.
"r": Read only

"w": Write (Overwrite the file completely)

"a": Append (Add to the end of the file)

"r+": Read and Write

-----------------------------------------------------
Classes, Objects and Inheritance

I can create multiple objects from the same class, and they will each hold their own unique data.

The __init__ function: It runs automatically when you create a new object to set up its initial data.

Inheritance: The ability to create a new class that "inherits" all functions from an existing class.

Brief Introduction to Colab

I can write and execute code in Python directly. It shows the output of blocks below them, which is good to test certain parts.
